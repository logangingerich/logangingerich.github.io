## Explanation

My task in this project was to create a Reddit clone that allowed users to sign up, create topics, create posts under the topics and comment on posts. Users also needed to have the ability to upvote or downvote posts. The user interface needed to be clear and simple to use.

## Implementation

I built Bloccit from the ground up using Ruby on Rails. Rails is a powerful back-end framework that allows for quick, efficient app-building. Users must create an account in order to create new topics, posts, or to comment/vote on a post.  I implemented Bloccit using Test-Driven Development (RSpec, in this case).

## Results

The resulting web application acts much like Reddit, giving users who have signed up for a Bloccit account the ability to create topics and posts, and interact with the posts/comments of other users.

## Conclusion

I found Ruby on Rails to be a very effective and efficient framework to use in implementing a Reddit-like web application. I look forward to using it on future projects requiring full-stack development.
