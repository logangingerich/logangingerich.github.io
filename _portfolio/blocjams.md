## Explanation

This school project was built in order to utilize HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to produce a responsive, easy-to-navigate website that can generate and play music from a library.

## Problem

The challenge here was to build an attractive and fully functional site for finding and playing music, much like Spotify

## Solution

I built the site initially through HTML and CSS, then added functionality and animation with Javascript and jQuery.

## Results

The resulting website is attractive and responsive, and functions much like a basic version of Spotify.

## Conclusion

This project was a terrific learning experience, allowing me to showcase basic web-building skills and produce a product of which I can be proud.
