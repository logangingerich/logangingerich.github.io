## Explanation

This project is a fully-functional geek fandom chatroom that allows users to log-in, create chatrooms and send messages, while seeing their rooms and messages populate in real time.

## Implementation

AngularJS was the framework on which I built this web application. I then linked it to a Firebase back-end database, allowing me to store chatrooms and their associated messages. Users are able to create a username, which is stored for future use via cookies.

## Results

The result is a fully-functional chatroom, which, for the amount of functionality, was built in a very short amount of time because of the ease of both the Angular framework and the Firebase database.

## Conclusion

AngularJS can have a bit of a steep learning curve for those starting out with web development, but it is a very powerful framework and a necessary tool for just about any full-stack web developer.
