## Explanation

This musical library web application was originally built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to produce an attractive, responsive, and easy-to-navigate website that can generate and play music from a library. The AngularJS framework was then implemented to simplify and streamline the application.

## Implementation

I had to take the look and aesthetics of the site into account, in addition to building a site that was easy to navigate and allowed users to find and play music.
I built the site initially through vanilla HTML and CSS, then added functionality and animation with Javascript and the jQuery library. After it was complete, I refactored the code using AngularJS as a framework.

## Results

The resulting website is attractive and responsive, and functions much like a basic version of Spotify.

## Conclusion

This project was a terrific learning experience, allowing me to showcase basic front-end web-building skills and produce a product of which I can be proud.

The app is also currently hosted on Heroku, and you can view it here: [Classic Jams Website](http://murmuring-earth-78585.herokuapp.com/).
