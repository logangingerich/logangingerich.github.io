## Explanation

This musical library web application was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to produce an attractive, responsive, and easy-to-navigate website that can generate and play music from a library.

## Problem

The challenge here was to build an attractive and fully functional site for finding and playing music, much like Spotify. I had to take the look and aesthetics of the site into account, in addition to building a site that was easy to navigate and allowed users to find and play music.

## Solution

I built the site initially through vanilla HTML and CSS, then added functionality and animation with Javascript and the jQuery library. After it was complete, I refactored the code using AngularJS as a framework.

## Results

The resulting website is attractive and responsive, and functions much like a basic version of Spotify.

## Conclusion

This project was a terrific learning experience, allowing me to showcase basic front-end web-building skills and produce a product of which I can be proud.
