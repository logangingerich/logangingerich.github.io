title: Back-End Development with RoR
---

Anybody who has gone through the process of learning to code knows that, at first, some things have to be taken on faith. That is particularly true if you start out by learning front-end programming. You learn the structural basics of HTML and styling with CSS. You add functionality and responsiveness with Javascript. It's all great and fascinating, but at a certain point you realize that you're only scratching the surface. There's so much more going on below the surface to make your web application work.

This is all part of the reason that I found diving in to back-end development so fascinating. You're able to really get a feel for the nuts and bolts of what you're creating. Ruby on Rails was the first framework that I used to build personal web applications from the ground up, including clones of Wikipedia and Reddit, as well as a Ruby Gem API client.

Understanding Rails, I found, is all about understanding its MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. In a very simplified way, the model communicates with your database, the controller takes in input and chooses appropriate actions as a response, and the view is what the user actually sees. All of this comes together to form the framework of your application.

I've found Ruby on Rails to be an amazingly effective framework for quickly and cleanly creating apps, and I'm excited to explore other frameworks in order to add some breadth to my back-end programming knowledge.
