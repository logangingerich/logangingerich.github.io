title: Why Software Development?
---

“What do you want to be when you grow up?”
We all heard it over and over again as we grew up. I, for one, always had an answer. I always knew exactly what I wanted to do. The only problem was—I kept changing my mind. I wanted to be a writer, filmmaker, professor, historian, firefighter, pilot and chef. I think I even wanted to be an accountant at one point. My interests have always been broad and I kept getting distracted by a new subculture or a new set of skills to learn. So, how have I found myself here, as a student of software development?

In hindsight, software development has always been the perfect path for me. The skills and tools available to become a better developer are virtually endless. This, for me, means endless learning and personal betterment. As a developer, you’re always looking ahead to what’s new and exciting and inspiring. There are constant, new developments in the world of software engineering for me to be excited about. There’s always a new project to be started.

Beyond this, I’ve always been fascinated with computers. I distinctly remember the day that my family got our first computer. I can see my dad pulling the strange yet oddly exciting contraption from its box. Sitting down at that early-90s computer and exploring the basic applications and games that blew my five-year-old brain, I felt like I was discovering a new world. (Honestly, my love of that computer was cemented when I discovered a dinosaur game that came with old-school 3D glasses that made it look as if the Tyrannosaurus Rex was coming out of the screen. Surely technology could never surpass that…)

Pulling back the curtain and learning what’s going on beneath the screen has been one of the mostly intellectually and creatively rewarding experiences I’ve ever had.   I hope to share some of my experiences of learning the skills of software development here, with the hope that they might be somewhat useful to anyone else considering breaking into the field. I’m finally confidant that I’ve found the right path for me and I’m looking forward to a lifetime of learning.
